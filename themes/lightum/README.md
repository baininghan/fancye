# Lightum

This is the theme I currently use for [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). It is based on [Light](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-light). See my blog as a [Demo](http://baininghan.com/).

For clarity, I leave all my settings unchanged. So you are suggested to modify the theme as you need.

## Install

Execute the following command and modify `theme` in `_config.yml` to `lightum`.

```
git clone https://github.com/zippera/lightum.git themes/lightum
```

## Update

Execute the following command to update Light.

```
cd themes/lightum
git pull
```
